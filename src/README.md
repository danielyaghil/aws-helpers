# AWS Helpers

This library provides a set of helpers to simplify the use of AWS services.
It encapsulates AWS Javascript SDK v3 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/) while providing a simple and easy to use interface.

**NOTE**: this is a work in progress and not all services are supported yet. It grows as I need it, so if you need a specific service or specific methods inside a service, please let me know or feel free to enhance ad submit your code.
